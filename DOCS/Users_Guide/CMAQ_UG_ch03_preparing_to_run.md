# 3. Preparing to Run CMAQ
**>>Comment<<** Add intro paragraph describing what will be in this chapter.

In this chapter the user will learn the basic hardware and software requirements to run CMAQ. In addition, if the user does not have the required software, this chapter provides detailed examples on how the user could obtain this software in a linux environment.

**>>Comment<<** Do we want to also recommend a compiler (intel) for speed?
## 3.1 Hardware Requirements

The minimum hardware requirements for running the CMAQ Program Suite on a PC are:

-   A single processor
-   1 GB RAM
-   100 GB hard drive storage

However, to use CMAQ in a production environment where multiple iterations of the model will be executed for different spatial domains and/or emissions control strategies, either a cluster of multiprocessor PCs on a high-end network or an expandable rack-mounted Linux server is recommended.

For example, the CMAQ team at the EPA uses a Dell cluster named Atmos. The cluster consists of 32 Dell PowerEdge C6320 servers, with a total of 256 processors, EDR infiniband interconnect and runs on Read Hat Enterprise Linux 7 operating system

## 3.2 Software Requirements

Before using the CMAQ program suite, the user must first download and configure their "computing" environment. A requirement for CMAQ is access to a linux environment, which can be done through a terminal emulator. Examples of terminal emulators are shown below:

-   **MAC OS X:** iTerm2
-   **Windows:** PuTTY, MobaXterm
-   **Linux:** Terminal, XTerm

When using the CMAQ program suite a common theme that will be seen is the use of shell scripts. In short, a shell script is basically a reciepe of commands that can be run to save time when performing a task. In the case of CMAQ, it is used to set variables, science options and run other programs.

At this point faimiliarity with linux command line prompts as well as basic shell scripting is expected.

Several of these steps are facilitated by having either root or sudo privileges on your system.  If you do not have these privileges, work with the system administrator to complete these steps.

CMAQ programs (source codes) are used to build "executables": binary files that consist of instructions that have been translated from their original [source code](http://www.linfo.org/sourcecode.html) (e.g., Fortran) into [machine code](http://www.linfo.org/machine_code.html) (also called machine language or object code) so that they are ready to be run (executed). Executable files are created through the use of a specialized program called a [compiler](http://www.linfo.org/compiler.html).

## 3.3 Install Fortran and C compilers
-----
There are several options for Fortran and C compilers. The [Fortran wiki](http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Compilers) includes a full list of free and commercial Fortran compilers.

Most Linux systems include the Gnu gfortran compiler by default. Other options that have been tested with CMAQ include the **Intel, Portland Group, and Absoft** compilers.

The following instructions are for Gnu compilers.  For other Fortran compilers, follow the instructions from the vendor.

Check for the Gnu gfortran compiler:

```
gfortran -v
```

Install on Debian/Ubuntu Linux:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install gfortran
```

Install on Red Hat/CentOS Linux:

```
sudo yum update
sudo yum install gcc-gfortran
```

Another common theme seen in the CMAQ program suite is the use of Fortran/C [Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.pdf). Makefiles are similar shell scripts in the sense that they describe the relationship between Fortran/C files and provides a receipe on how to link and compile them to build an executable. This is convenient because if one file changes in the program suite, the Makefile will recompile and link all the necessary programs by running the commands below.

Common shell commands to invoke the Makefile include:

``
make
``

This shell command invokes the Makefile and follows the reciepe on how to compile and link the program files listed to update the CMAQ executable.

``
make clean
``

This shell command cleans the directory (i.e. removes any links between files and any intermediary files).

## 3.4 Install Git
-----
Git is a source code control and management software.  It is used in the CMAQ installation to download stable versions of the source code. Additional resources can be found at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2.

Install on Debian/Ubuntu Linux:

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

Install on Red Hat/CentOS Linux:

```
$ sudo yum install git
```

## 3.5 Download the source and install the netCDF library
-----
The netCDF library is used to control the data structures of the CMAQ input/output files.

Download the latest netCDF release from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ and follow the instructions to install on your system.  

** Compile netCDF without netCDF4 and HDF5 support. **

The general steps for installation on a Linux system with, C-shell, GCC and Gfortran are below.  These instructions are an example and we recommend using the latest release available at the time of your CMAQ installation.

```
### Set up your Linux system environment
setenv CC gcc
setenv CPPFLAGS  '-DNDEBUG –DgFortran'
setenv CFLAGS  -O
setenv FC  gfortran
setenv FFLAGS  '-O –w'
setenv CXX  g++

## Install netCDF-C
wget ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4.4.1.1.tar.gz
tar xvzf netcdf-4.4.1.1.tar.gz
cd netcdf-4.4.1.1
./configure --disable-netcdf-4 --disable-dap
make check install
cd ../

## Install netCDF-Fortran
setenv NCDIR {location of netCDF C installation}
setenv CPPFLAGS "$CPPFLAGS -I${NCDIR}/include LDFLAGS=-L${NCDIR}/lib"
wget ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-fortran-4.4.4.tar.gz
tar xvzf netcdf-4.4.4.tar.gz
cd netcdf-4.4.4
./configure
make check
make install
```
Additional instruction and options for compiling netCDF are on the [Unidata C netCDF installation](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html) and [Fortran netCDF installation](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/building_netcdf_fortran.html) pages.

## 3.6 Download the source and install the I/O API library
-----
The I/O API library is used for the input/output data flows in CMAQ.

Download the I/O API source code from the CMAS Center and put the gzipped tarball on your Linux system. The general steps for installation on a Linux system with, C-shell, GCC and Gfortran are below. These instructions are an example and we recommend using the latest release available at the time of your CMAQ installation.

```
### Set up your Linux system environment
setenv BIN Linux2_x86_64gfort

## Install I/O API
tar xvzf ioapi-3.1.tar.gz
cd ioapi
cp Makefile.nocpl Makefile
```

Edit the Makefile and change the variable BASEDIR to point to the I/O API installation directory on your Linux system. After saving the file run the command make to build the library:

```
make
```

## 3.7 Install a Message Passing Interface (MPI) library
-----
The MPI library is used to create parallel (multiple processor) applications of CMAQ.  CMAQ has been tested with the [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org), [MVAPICH2](http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu), and the [Intel MPI](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mpi-library) libraries. This example shows how to install OpenMPI on a Linux system with, C-shell, GCC and Gfortran are below. These instructions are an example and we recommend using the latest release available at the time of your CMAQ installation.

nstall on Debian/Ubuntu Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install openmpi openmpi-devel
```

Install on Red Hat/CentOS Linux:

```
sudo yum install openmpi openmpi-devel
```
