# CMAQv5.3 User's Guide


The CMAQ User's Guide is designed to support the installation, configuration, and execution of the [Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ)](http://www.epa.gov/cmaq) model on Linux systems. CMAQ users should be comfortable with Linux scripting conventions and have some familiarity with the Fortran programming language. Users should also have some familiarity with atmospheric structure, and the physical and chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere.

The following sections are included in this guide:

[CMAQ Tutorials:](Tutorials/README.md) A series of short tutorials provide practical examples of how to set up and run CMAQ. 

[Chapter 1 (Overview):](CMAQ_UG_ch01_overview.md) CMAQ background, features, requirements and support resources.

[Chapter 2 (Program Structure):](CMAQ_UG_ch02_program_structure.md) Overview of the CMAQ system and programs.

[Chapter 3 (Preparing to Run):](CMAQ_UG_ch03_preparing_to_run.md) Hardware and software requirements for running CMAQ.

[Chapter 4 (Model Inputs):](CMAQ_UG_ch04_model_inputs.md) Descriptions of the CMAQ input files.

[Chapter 5 (Running CMAQ):](CMAQ_UG_ch05_running_CMAQ.md) How to obtain the CMAQ source codes, set-up your environment and run a simulation.
