# Model Input Files

This chapter provides basic information on the format and content of CMAQ files.  A list of CMAQ input files can be found in [Table 3-3](#Input_Table) and a list of output files is given in [Table 3-8](#Output_Table). Some CMAQ files are in ASCII format while the majority of them are binary files and are in the [Network Common Data Form (netCDF)](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf). The netCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data (Unidata, 2009). The netCDF library provides an implementation of the netCDF interface for several different programming languages. CMAQ input and output files are self-describing netCDF-format files in which the file headers have all the dimensioning and descriptive information needed to define the resident data. Users should download the latest code for the NetCDF from the [NetCDF website](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf). Compilation and configuration information for the NetCDF is available through the Unidata website.

**>>Comment<<** Throughout… need to de-emphasize I/O API language and dependencies. I think we can reference Carlie's page rather than trying to repeat it all here. I/O API may not be required and may become optional VERY soon.

Input/Output Applications Programming Interface (I/O API)
---------------------------------------------------------
**>>COMMENT<<** only a subset of this information needs to be kept; much of the subsection material can be found online and needs to be de-emphasized here.Consider removing the table describing Time Step Structures and Data Type Structures altogether.  This information can be briefly described in text to describe the GRIDDED3 and BNDARY3 files.

The Models-3 Input/Output Applications Programming Interface (I/O API) is an environmental software development library that provides an input/output framework for the CMAQ programs, inlcuding a set of commonly used subroutines for passing information between source code modules and for reading and writing data files (Coats, 2005). An additional benefit of the I/O API is that an expansive set of data manipulation utilities and statistical analysis programs is available to evaluate and postprocess the binary CMAQ input/output data files. Users should download the latest code for the I/O API from the [website](https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi). In order to work with I/O API buffered file format, which is used in the WRF-CMAQ two-way coupled model, and/or to perform parallel I/O operations in CMAQ 5.0.1 or later version, users should use IOAPI 3.2. For CMAQ users using preconfigured applications of the model, the I/O API system can be essentially transparent. For users who plan to modify the code or implement updated modules for research purposes, a few key elements of the I/O API should be understood, and they are discussed below. For more detailed information about developing new modules for CMAQ using the I/O API code libraries, please refer to the [I/O API User's Manual](https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/documentation/all_versions/html).

** >> Comment <<** In the paragraph below, the “CMAQ_OGD_Chapter6_review_DW.docx” marked-up file had an edit that described a “Red Hat 51 Linux Workstation.” However, the number 51 did not appear in the original Atom file, nor did “51” appear to be an addition within the marked-up file. So I am just making sure "51" actually belongs in the document and isn’t an unintentional remnant of something else

### I/O API Data Structure and Data File Types
Each CMAQ data file has internal file descriptions that contain the file type, the file start date and time, the file time step, the grid and coordinate descriptions, and a set of descriptions for the set of variables contained within the file (i.e., names, units specifications, and text descriptions). Some of the elements in a file description, such as the dates and times for file creation and update and the name of the program that created the file, are maintained automatically by the I/O API. The remainder of the descriptive information must be provided at the time of file creation.

**>>COMMENT<<** DS: We should probable talk about dot and cross points below

While the CMAQ input and output files use a Network Common Data Form (netCDF) file format, the files contain specific spatial information that is expected by the I/O API. The I/O API convention of defining horizontal grids is to use a combination of the map projection and an offset from the projection center to the southwest corner of the modeling domain. After defining the southwest corner of the domain, or the “offset” from the projection center, the I/O API grid definition specifies the size of the horizontal grid cells and the number of cells in the X and Y directions. According to the I/O API format, files and variables are referred to by names, layers are referred to by numbers (from 1 to the greatest number of layers in the file), and dates and times are stored as integers, using the coding formats *YYYYDDD* (commonly called “JDATE”) and *HHMMSS* (commonly called “JTIME”), where

YYYYDAY = (1000 * Year) + Julian Day
HHMMSS = (10000 * Hour) + (100 * Minute) + Seconds.

All files manipulated by the I/O API may have multiple variables and multiple layers. Each file also has a time-step structure that is shared by all of its variables. There are three kinds of time-step structures supported ([Table 3‑1](#Time_Steps)). The data type structures that are supported are listed in [Table 3-2](#Data_Structure). Within a file, all the variables are data arrays with the same dimensions, number of layers, and data structure type, although possibly different basic types (e.g., gridded and boundary variables cannot be mixed within the same file, but real and integer variables can).

<a id=Time_Steps></a>
**Table 3‑1. Possible Time Step Structures in I/O API Files**

|**File Type**|**Description**|
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Time-independent|The file’s time-step attribute is set to zero. Routines that use time-independent files ignore the date and time arguments.|
|Time-stepped|The file has a starting date, a starting time, and a positive time step. Read and write requests must be for some positive integer multiple of the time step from the starting date and time.|
|Circular-buffer|This type of file keeps only two “records”, the “even” part and the “odd” part (useful, for example, for “restart” files where only the last data written in the file are used). The file’s description has a starting date, a starting time, and a negative time step (set to the negative of the actual time step). Read and write requests must be for some positive integer multiple of the time step from the starting date and time, and they must reflect a specific time step that is in the file.|

# CMAQ Input and Output Files #

[Jump to Input Files](#inputs)<br>
[Jump to CCTM Output Files](#outputs)

**>>COMMENT<<** Update or remove reference to chapters from old User's document

CMAQ requires a basic set of input files: initial condition file, which is created by ICON process or previous day output; boundary condition file, which is created by BCON process; emission files; and meteorological data created by MCIP using WRF and terrain data. There are a few other input files are required bases on user chosen run time option. CMAQ output files include a basic set of files with aerosol and gas-phase species concentrations, wet and dry deposition estimates, and visibility metrics, and an auxiliary set of output files for diagnosing model performance and in-line-calculated emissions.

Rather than forcing the programmer and program-user to deal with hard-coded file names or hard-coded unit numbers, the I/O API utilizes the concept of logical file names. The modelers can define the logical names as properties of a program, and then at run-time the logical names can be linked to the actual file name using environment variables. For programming purposes, the only limitations are that file names cannot contain blank spaces and must be at most 16 characters long. When a modeler runs a program that uses the I/O API, environment variables must be used to set the values for the program’s logical file names. A complete list of CMAQ input and output files by logical name is provided in Tables 3-3 and 3-8.

<a id=inputs></a>
## CMAQ Input Files

This section describes each of the input files required by the various CMAQ programs. The section begins with a description of the grid definition file, GRIDDESC, which is used by several CMAQ programs, and then goes through a program-by-program listing of the CMAQ input file requirements. [Table 3-3](#$Input_Table) lists the source, file type, and temporal and spatial dimensions of each CMAQ input file. Sample disk space requirements for a desired input data set can easily be calculated from the information in [Table 3-3](#Input_Table); each data record is four bytes. The I/O API file sizes can be calculated using the number of variables in a CMAQ file and the spatial and temporal coverage of the data. The user should consult the CMAQ release notes for additional file information. The programs used to generate the files ("Source") are described in Section 2.

<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->
**>> Comment <<** In Table 8.1, some of the potential sources for the files have not been explained elsewhere (e.g., CSV2NML, Spatial Allocator, Cropcal).

**>> Comment <<** In Table 8.1, those Hourly denotation, we should put an asterisk to indicate that it can be user defined, e.g. 30 minutes rather 1 hour and in the same table and table 8-13, there are places with +1 and I think we can make it more generic as +NTHIK (your call).

**>> Comment <<** DW: Also I think we should remove everything related to/associated with JPROC and JTABLE since CMAQ does not use it anymore and they are highlighted in the PDF file.

**>> Comment <<** DS: Should the column header by "Environment Variable Namefor File" or "Logical File Name"?

### GRIDDESC: Horizontal domain definition
[Return to Table 3-3](#griddesc_t)

Used by: ICON, BCON, CCTM

The CMAQ grid description file (**GRIDDESC**) is an ASCII file that contains two sections: a horizontal coordinate section, and grid description section.  The GRIDDESC file is generated automatically with MCIP; alternatively, GRIDDESC can be created using a text editor.

The horizontal coordinate section consists of text records that provide the coordinate-system name, the map projection, and descriptive parameters that are relevant to the projection type (e.g. longitude for coordinate system center)

The grid description section consists of text records that indicate the grid name, related coordinate-system name (i.e., which GRIDDESC horizontal coordinate name that is defined in the previous section that is applied to this grid), and descriptive parameters for the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the grid, grid cell size, number of columns, and rows. For a typical CMAQ application, both "dot-point" and "cross-point" grids are defined in the GRIDDESC file; these grids are topological duals in the sense that the vertices (corners) of one correspond to the cell-centers of the other. There are at most 32 coordinate systems and 256 grids listed in one of these files. These files are small enough to be archived easily with a study, and have a sufficiently simple format that new ones can easily be constructed "by hand."

An example of a GRIDDESC file is shown below:

` ' '`
` 'LAM_40N100W'`
` 2 30.0 60.0 -100.0 -100.0 40.0`
` ' '`
` 'M_32_99TUT02'`
` 'LAM_40N100W' 544000.0 -992000.0 32000.0 32000.0 38 38 1`
` ' '`

The horizontal coordinate section (first section) in this example GRIDDESC file defines a horizontal coordinate named “LAM_40N100W”. The coordinate definition is for a Lambert conformal grid, keyed by the first column of the coordinate description line, which corresponds to the numeric code for the various I/O API-supported grid types (2 = Lambert). The next three parameters (P_ALP, P_BET, and P_GAM) have different definitions for different map projections. For Lambert conformal, P_ALP and P_BET are the true latitudes of the projection cone (30°N and 60°N in the example), and P_GAM (100°W in the example) is the central meridian of the projection. The last two parameters, XCENT and YCENT, are the latitude-longitude coordinates of the grid center of the Cartesian coordinate system, which are 100°W and 40°N in the example. If using WRF-ARW as the meteorological model, the user should be aware of differences from this method.

The example grid definition section above describes a grid named “M_32_99TUT02”. The definition of the grid begins with a reference to a coordinate name from the coordinate definition section of the file; in this example, the coordinate named “LAM_40N100W” is referenced in the grid definition. The next two parameters in the grid definition (XORIG and YORIG) are the east-west and north-south offsets from XCENT and YCENT in meters (WRF-ARW usages may differ). The next two parameters (XCELL and YCELL) are the horizontal grid spacing in meters for the X and Y directions (i.e., delta-x and delta-y). The next two parameters (NCOLS and NROWS) are the numbers of grid cells in the X and Y directions. The grid definition concludes with the number of boundary cells, NTHIK, which is typically set to 1.

### {gc|ae|nr|tr}_matrix.nml: Species namelist files
[Return to Table 3-3](#matrix_nml_t)

Used by: BCON, CCTM, ICON, CHEMMECH

Namelist look-up tables for different classes of simulated pollutants are used to define the parameters of different model species during the execution of the CMAQ programs. Gas-phase (gc), aerosol (ae), non-reactive (nr), and tracer (tr) species namelist files contain parameters for the model species that are included in these different classifications. The species namelist files are used to control how the different CMAQ programs and processes handle the model species. The namelist files define the following processes for each model species:


-   Deposition velocity – which (if any) deposition velocity is the deposition velocity for the pollutant mapped to; allowed velocities are specified within the model source code.
-   Deposition velocity factor – if the pollutant is mapped to a deposition velocity, uniformly apply a scaling factor to this velocity.
-   Initial condition– which initial condition species is the pollutant mapped to; if not specified, this will default to the species name.
-   IC Factor – if the pollutant is mapped to an initial condition species, uniformly apply a scaling factor to the concentrations.
-   Boundary condition – which boundary condition species is the pollutant mapped to; if not specified, this will default to the species name.
-   BC Factor – if the pollutant is mapped to an boundary condition species, uniformly apply a scaling factor to the concentrations.
-   Scavenging - which (if any) species is the pollutant mapped to; Allowed scavenging surrogates are specified within the model source code.
-   Scavenging factor - if the pollutant is mapped to an species for scavenging, uniformly apply a scaling factor to the scavenging rate.
-   Gas-to-aerosol conversion – which (if any) aerosol chemistry species does the gas phase pollutant concentration go into for transformation from the gas-phase to the aerosol-phase.
-   Gas-to-aqueous Surrogate – which (if any) cloud chemistry species does the gas pollutant concentration go into for simulating chemistry within cloud water.
-   Aerosol-to-aqueous Surrogate – which (if any) cloud chemistry species does the aerosol pollutant concentration go into for simulating chemistry within cloud water.
-   Transport – is the pollutant transported by advection and diffusion in the model?
-   Dry deposition – Write the pollutant to the dry deposition output file?
-   Wet deposition – Write the pollutant to the wet deposition output file?
-   Concentration – Write the pollutant to the instantaneous concentration output file?

The namelist files contain header information that describe which class of species are contained in the file, the number of parameters contained in the file, headers describing the parameter fields, and then a series of rows with configuration parameters for every model species. [Table 3-4](#Table8-4) contains the namelist file format for the gas-phase (GC) species namelist file. The namelist files for the other species classifications (AE, NR, TR) are similar to the format shown in [Table 3-4](#Table8-4).

The namelist files for the other pollutant classes have similar configurations as the gas-phase species configuration shown in [Table 3-4](#Table8-4). For an example see this [link](../../CCTM/src/MECHS/cb06r3_ae7_aq/GC_cb6r3_ae7_aq.nml) to the GC namelist species file for the cb06r3_ae7_aq mechanism.

## Initial Condition Inputs
<a id=init_conc_1></a>

### INIT_CONC_1: Initial conditions
[Return to Table 3-3](#init_conc_1_t)

Used by: CCTM

The initial concentrations of each species being modeled must be input to CMAQ. The initial conditions input file type is GRDDED3 and does not vary with time. The file data are looped in this manner: by column, by row, by layer, by variable. Initial conditions files have the same structure as concentration files, so the predicted concentrations from the last hour of day 1 can be used to initialize the following day’s simulation. This gives CMAQ users the flexibility to segment simulations in any way they choose.

## Boundary Condition Inputs
<a id=bndy_conc_1></a>

### BNDY_CONC_1: Boundary conditions
[Return to Table 3-3](#bndy_conc_1_t)

Used by: CCTM

CMAQ boundary condition data are of the BNDARY3 file type. Produced by the boundary condition processor, BCON, CCTM reads these data and correlates them with the interior data by the use of a pointer system. This pointer system designates the beginning location of the data in memory that start a new side of the domain (i.e., south, east, north, or west).

Each species being modeled should be in the BNDY_CONC_1 file. If some modeled species are not contained in this file, the boundary condition for these species will default to the value 1 × 10e<sup>-30</sup>. The perimeter of the CMAQ domain is NTHIK cell wide (typically NTHIK = 1), where the number of boundary cells = (2*NROW*NTHIK)+(2*NCOL*NTHIK)+(4*NTHIK*NTHIK).

## Emissions Inputs
<a id=emis_1></a>

### EMIS_1: Emissions
[Return to Table 3-1](#emis_1_t)

**>> Comment <<** DW: Since Ben has new emission system in place in CMAQ 53, he should modify the emission portion accordingly.

Used by: CCTM

CMAQ can accept emissions inputs from a variety of emissions models and preprocessors. The most commonly used option is the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) modeling system, which is a collection of programs that separately process and merge emissions data for each emissions sector for input to air quality models.

The emissions file sorts the emitted gas-phase and aerosol species by grid cell and time. The file type is GRDDED3, and the units are in moles per second (moles s<sup>-1</sup>) for gas-phase species and grams per second (g s<sup>-1</sup>) for aerosol species. The file data are looped as follows: by column, by row, by layer, by variable, and by input time step. CMAQ does not artificially distinguish between surface and elevated emissions sources; elevated sources are provided to CMAQ as vertically resolved emissions. For CCTM configurations that do not use in-line emissions calculations, all emissions estimates are contained within a single input emission file for each day. In v4.7, CMAQ now has the capability to process point-source, sea salt, and biogenic emissions in-line. The supplemental input files to use for calculating the in-line emissions are described in the CMAQv4.7 release notes.

## Biogenic and Land Surface Inputs
<a id=ocean_1></a>
### OCEAN_1: Sea salt mask
[Return to Table 3-1](#ocean_1_t)

Used by: CCTM

The CMAQ aerosol models AERO5 and AERO6 can compute sea salt emissions from both open ocean grid cells and surf zone grid cells. The addition of the surf zone option simulates the elevated emissions rates of sea salt in coastal regions where wave action occurs. The OCEAN_1 file contains data on the fraction of each grid cell that is either open ocean (OPEN) or in the surf zone (SURF). When CCTM is compiled with AERO5 or AERO6, it will expect the OCEAN_1 file as input.

<a id=gspro></a>
### GSPRO: Speciation profiles
[Return to Table 3-1](#gspro_t)

Used by: CCTM – inline emissions version only

The speciation profile file, GSPRO, contains the factors that are used to separate aggregated inventory pollutant emissions totals into emissions of model species in the form required by CMAQ. If only biogenic emissions are being calculated in-line in CMAQ, the GSPRO file used by CCTM needs to contain split factors only for the biogenic VOC emissions that are input in the B3GRD file. If other emissions sources are being calculated by CCTM, VOC split factors for these other sources must be included in the GSPRO file. The GSPRO file format is listed in the SMOKE user’s manual, see: [GSPRO documentation](https://www.cmascenter.org/smoke/documentation/4.0/html/ch08s05s02.html).

### BIOSEASON: Freeze dates
[Return to Table 3-1](#bioseason_t)

Used by: CCTM – inline-emissions version only

The BIOSEASON switch file is an I/O API GRDDED3 file used to indicate which biogenic emissions factor to use on each day in a given year for every grid cell in the modeling domain. This file can be created using the Metscan utility program that is distributed with SMOKE. The BIOSEASON file is time-dependent and usually contains data for an entire year (365 or 366 days). It uses one variable, SEASON, which is either 0 (grid cell should use winter factors for current day) or 1 (grid cell should use summer factors for current day). For additional information about creating the BIOSEASON file, see the [Metscan documentation](https://www.cmascenter.org/smoke/documentation/4.0/html/ch05s03s10.html) in the SMOKE user’s manual.
