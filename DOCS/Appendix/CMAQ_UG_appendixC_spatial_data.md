# Appendix C: Processing Spatial Data for CMAQ Inputs

## Geospatial Data

Air quality modeling requires many spatial data in order to generate anthropogenic,
biogenic, fire, sea salt, dust, and NH3 emissions. In addition, land surface characteristics such as
land cover types with vegetation leaf area index (LAI) and fraction, albedo, and soil types are required in
modeling the exchanges of heat, moisture, and momentum between the land and atmosphere and dry deposition
of trace chemicals (e.g. O3 and NH3). It is important to use a consistent coordinate system for all of the
geospatial data used in emission, meteorology, and air quality modeling. Most of the geospatial data
required for the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE)/Weather Research and Forecasting
(WRF)/CMAQ modeling can be generated using the Spatial Allocator (SA) that includes three components
developed for specific applications: Vector, Raster, and Surrogate Tools.

In using the spatial data, it is important to know the datum, which is a spheroidal (either spherical
 or ellipsoidal) surface that represents the surface of the earth, and the projection, which is a
 mathematic transformation that converts a location on the datum to the location on a flat plane.
 The following sections briefly describe the appropriate datum and projections to use with the CMAQ system
 and the methods for generating the needed spatial data in the correct form.

### Geodetic datum

 A geodetic datum is a coordinate system used to define a location on the Earth.
 There are many datums used in spatial datasets depending on what geographic regions they are and
 how the Earth’s surface is approximated as a spheroid.  Most of U.S. geospatial data are defined in
 North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) and the global data sets are often defined in World Geodetic System
1984 (WGS84).

WRF datasets are in WGS84.  All latitude-longitude geographic data sets used in a CMAQ simulation,
such as emissions shapefiles, land use or biogenic data files, and the ocean file, should be in WGS84
so that they are spatially aligned with the WRF files.  For simulations over North America, NAD83 is only
slightly different from the WGS84 datum.  As a result, NAD83 can be used for North America domains without
introducing spatial misalignment issues in the model datasets.

### Spatial Data Projection

CMAQ can use any of the [four map projections defined for WRF](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user_guide_V3/users_guide_chap3.htm)
 `EXIT` The four map projection coordinate
systems are regular latitude-longitude geographic, Lambert conformal conic, Mercator, and Polar
stereographic. It is important to know that in projecting spatial data that is in WGS84 to the CMAQ
projection or projecting CMAQ data to another map projection, users SHOULD NOT do any datum transformation.
This is consistent with the WRF preprocessing system (WPS). Datum transformation will result in
 geographic location shifting.

The CMAQ domain projection is defined through PROJ.4 using a spherical surface with an earth radius
of 6370000 m to match the WRF domain projection definition.  Once an input dataset is in WGS84 the
following examples can be used to define the projection transformation needed to match the WRF data:

Lambert Conformal Conic:  "+proj=lcc +a=6370000.0 +b=6370000.0 +lat_1=33 +lat_2=45 +lat_0=40 +lon_0=-97"

Polar stereographic:  "+proj=stere +a=6370000.0 +b=6370000.0 +lat_ts=33 +lat_0=90 +lon_0=-97 +k_0=1.0"

Mercator:  "+proj=merc +a=6370000.0 +b=6370000.0 +lat_ts=33 +lon_0=0"

Geographic:  "+proj=latlong +a=6370000.0 +b=6370000.0"

### Spatial Data Generation

Emission spatial allocation surrogates are required for generating anthropogenic emissions by SMOKE to
spatially allocate county-based emission inventory to model grid cells. Emission surrogates can be based
on population, roads, airports, railroads, and land use spatial data sets. The SA Vector and Surrogate
Tools can be used to generate all needed emission surrogates for SMOKE.

**Biogenic emissions** require land use input including different tree species. There are three ways to
compute the required input for the domain covering the continental U.S. (CONUS).

1. The original method—re-grid Biogenic Emissions Landuse Database, Version 3 (BELD3) using a SA Vector
allocation tool. The BELD3 data is generated from the early 1990s AVHRR land cover data and FIA tree
species at county.
2. The second method—use the SA Raster BELD4 land cover generation tool to generate model domain land use
 data with tree species. Then, a provided utility is used to convert the generated land cover data into
 an I/O API format for CMAQ input. The limitation for this tool is that the early 1990s FIA tree species
 table at county is still used in allocating FIA tree species.
3. The most recent method—re-grid BELD4 data generated from 2011 NLCD data and new FIA tree species using
 a SA Vector allocation tool.

**Fire emissions** require fire location, burned areas, and detailed fuel load information.
Fire locations are available vis satellite detections from the Hazard Mapping System (HMS) or ground
level reports from the National Fire and Aviation Management web application.  Burn Area estimates can
be obtained from GIS based sources such as the Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination (GeoMac) website or
the U.S. National Historical Fire Perimeters Data Basin Dataset.  Fuel loading is estimated using a
geospatial dataset such as the US Forest Service Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS).
All of these information sources can be used to estimate fire emissions. An example of a tool that can
be used to generate fire emissions is the BlueSky modeling framework.  BlueSky modularly links a variety
of independent models of fire information, fuel loading, fire consumption, fire emissions, and smoke
dispersion.  Using these tools and estimating fire emissions can be quite complex so datasets of fire
emissions have been created for the community. Examples of these datasets is the Fire INventory from
the National Center for Atmospheric Research (FINN) or the Global Fire Emissions Database.

**Sea salt emissions** require open ocean and surface zone (50m) buffer fractions for the modeling grid
 cells in an I/O API file. For most of North American domain, a SA Vector allocation tool can be used
 to generate the surf zone and open ocean file from a polygon shapefile with land, surf zone buffer,
 and open ocean in SA data directory. For areas outside U.S., users have to generate a surf zone polygon
 shapefile with has the same attribute as the file in the SA in order to use the tool.

**Dust emissions** require the land use and vegetation fraction data. The land use data used for the
biogenic emission modeling is also used for dust emission computation. In addition, MODIS fraction of
photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) is used as the surrogate for the vegetation fraction. Users
can use WPS to re-grid MODIS 10-year average vegetation FPAR for their domains or use the SA raster tool
to re-grid downloaded MODIS LAI and FPAR products. We recommend the use of the gap-filled and smoother
MODIS LAI/FPAR products from the North American Carbon Program because of the jumping tendency of LAI
and FPAR values due to the influence of the and atmosphere condition.

**NH3 emissions** from agricultural lands can be estimated using the CMAQ bi-directional NH3 model. The
input for the CMAQ bi-directional NH3 model is generated by the Fertilizer Emission Scenario Tool for
CMAQ (FEST-C) system. FEST-C contains three main components: Java interface, Environmental Policy
Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, and SA Raster Tools. The interface guides users through generating
required land user and crop data and EPIC input files and simulating EPIC, and extracting EPIC output
for CMAQ. The generated BELD4 land use data by FEST-C needs to be converted into an I/O API format
using a utility program in FEST-C for CMAQ input.

**Land use and land cover data for surface flux modeling** in meteorology and air quality can be
generated using WPS or the SA Raster Tools. It is important to use consistent land use data in both
meteorology and air quality modeling. For most of the North America, WPS contains re-gridded 9-arc
second (around 250 m resolution) 2011 NLCD land cover, imperviousness, and canopy data with 2011 MODIS
land cover for the area outside the U.S. In addition, users can use the land use re-gridding tool in the
SA Raster Tools system to generate any domain land cover data directly using NLCD (at 30 m resolution)
or/and MODIS land cover data (at 1 km or 500 m resolution). Users can use a provided R utility in SA to
update their geogrid land cover data using the more accurate land cover data generating using SA.
